# Pure Palindrome - Palindrome

The API that is intended to be built here should accept the strings and show whether the words in the content are pure palindrome or palindrome. The API should return an array of objects as JSON.

The UI should highlight pure palindrome rows (if is_pure_palindrome = true for row data) in green
The user interface should highlight the palindrome but not highlight pure palindrome lines in yellow.
If the text is not a palindrome, the UI lines should be highlighted in red.
